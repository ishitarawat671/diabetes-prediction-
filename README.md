🩺 Diabetes Prediction Dashboard

Diabetes Prediction Dashboard is an interactive web application built with Python and Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in a patient using Logistic Regression. It provides a dynamic, visually appealing interface with live charts, animated metrics, and responsive design, making it suitable for both learning and demonstration purposes.

🌟 Features

Interactive Prediction Form: Input patient parameters like pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, BMI, age, and more to predict diabetes.

Logistic Regression Model: Predicts the probability of diabetes with a trained model on the full Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.

Live Probability Charts: Visual bar chart shows the predicted probability for diabetic and non-diabetic outcomes.

Comparison Charts: See how patient data (like glucose) compares with the dataset distribution.

Animated Metric Cards: Accuracy, training size, and testing size metrics glow and pulse based on performance.

Confusion Matrix & Classification Report: Quickly evaluate model performance visually.

Fully Interactive & Animated Dashboard: Gradient background, fade-in elements, chart hover effects, and glowing buttons make the UI engaging.

📊 Dataset

Dataset used: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

Contains patient health metrics and diabetes outcome (1 = diabetic, 0 = non-diabetic).

Columns:

pregnancies, glucose, diastolic (BP), triceps thickness, insulin, bmi, dpf (diabetes pedigree function), age, diabetes (target).

🛠 Technologies Used

Python – Backend logic and machine learning.

Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation.

Scikit-learn – Model building (Logistic Regression, scaling, train-test split).

Seaborn & Matplotlib – Charts and visualizations.

Streamlit – Web application framework for building interactive dashboards.

HTML & CSS – Animated UI elements, glowing metric cards, hover effects.
